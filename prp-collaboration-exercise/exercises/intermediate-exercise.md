# Intermediate Exercise: Collaborative Todo List Application

## Exercise Overview

**Difficulty**: Intermediate  
**Estimated Time**: 4-5 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Web development basics, understanding of authentication, database concepts

## Your Task

Create a comprehensive PRP for a web-based collaborative todo list application with real-time updates. This exercise challenges you to think about multi-user systems, authentication, real-time communication, and scalable architecture.

## Background Scenario

"TeamSync Inc." is building a project management suite for remote teams. As the first module, they want a collaborative todo list that allows team members to work together in real-time.

- Workspace deleted while users are active
- Network disconnection during updates

### Security Concerns
- Prevent unauthorized workspace access
- Rate limit authentication attempts
- Sanitize user input
- Prevent privilege escalation
- Secure sensitive data

### Scale Challenges
- Large number of todos
- Many concurrent users
- Real-time update storms
- Database connection pooling
- Caching strategies

### User Experience
- Smooth real-time updates
- Optimistic UI updates
- Graceful error recovery
- Progressive enhancement
- Accessibility features

## Deliverables

Your PRP should include:

1. **Complete System Design**: All components and interactions
2. **API Specification**: Endpoints, requests, responses
3. **Database Schema**: Tables, relationships, indexes
4. **WebSocket Events**: All real-time events defined
5. **Security Measures**: Authentication, authorization, validation
6. **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive test plan
7. **Deployment Guide**: How to deploy the system

## Evaluation Criteria

Your PRP will be evaluated on:

## Sample API Endpoints

To help structure your thinking:

```
Authentication:
POST   /api/auth/register
POST   /api/auth/login
POST   /api/auth/refresh
POST   /api/auth/logout
POST   /api/auth/forgot-password

Workspaces:
GET    /api/workspaces
POST   /api/workspaces
GET    /api/workspaces/:id
PUT    /api/workspaces/:id
DELETE /api/workspaces/:id
POST   /api/workspaces/:id/invite
POST   /api/workspaces/:id/members

Todos:
GET    /api/workspaces/:wid/todos
POST   /api/workspaces/:wid/todos
GET    /api/workspaces/:wid/todos/:tid
PUT    /api/workspaces/:wid/todos/:tid
DELETE /api/workspaces/:wid/todos/:tid
POST   /api/workspaces/:wid/todos/:tid/comments
```

## Sample WebSocket Events

```javascript
// Client to Server
socket.emit('join-workspace', { workspaceId, token })
socket.emit('todo-update', { todoId, changes })
socket.emit('todo-create', { todo })
socket.emit('todo-delete', { todoId })
socket.emit('typing', { todoId, isTyping })

// Server to Client
socket.on('todo-updated', { todo, updatedBy })
socket.on('todo-created', { todo, createdBy })
socket.on('todo-deleted', { todoId, deletedBy })
socket.on('user-joined', { user })
socket.on('user-left', { userId })
socket.on('user-typing', { userId, todoId })
```

## Database Schema Hints

```sql
Tables to consider:
- users (id, email, password_hash, verified, created_at)
- workspaces (id, name, owner_id, created_at)
- workspace_members (workspace_id, user_id, role, joined_at)
- todos (id, workspace_id, title, description, assignee_id, status, priority, due_date)
- todo_comments (id, todo_id, user_id, content, created_at)
- activity_logs (id, workspace_id, user_id, action, entity_type, entity_id, timestamp)
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Underestimating Complexity**: Real-time sync is complex
2. **Security Afterthought**: Build security in from start
3. **No Conflict Resolution**: Define how to handle simultaneous edits
4. **Poor Error Handling**: Real-time systems need robust error recovery
5. **Ignoring Scale**: Plan for growth from beginning
6. **Weak Testing**: Real-time features need thorough testing

## Bonus Challenges (Optional)

Advanced features to consider:
1. **Offline Mode**: Work offline and sync when connected
2. **Mobile Apps**: React Native or Flutter apps
3. **AI Features**: Smart task suggestions
4. **Integrations**: Slack, Calendar, GitHub
5. **Analytics**: Productivity insights
6. **Automation**: Recurring todos, templates

## Questions to Consider

Before writing your PRP:

1. How will you handle authentication across WebSocket connections?
2. What's your strategy for real-time conflict resolution?
3. How will you optimize database queries for large workspaces?
4. What caching strategy will you use?
5. How will you handle user permissions efficiently?
6. What's your approach to testing real-time features?

## Success Tips

1. **Think System-Wide**: Consider all components and interactions
2. **Security First**: Build security into every layer
3. **Plan for Scale**: Design for 10x current requirements
4. **User Experience**: Consider the complete user journey
5. **Be Specific**: Vague requirements cause implementation issues
6. **Test Everything**: Real-time systems need comprehensive testing

Remember: This PRP should be detailed enough that a development team can build a production-ready application without needing clarification meetings!

Good luck with your intermediate PRP! 💪
