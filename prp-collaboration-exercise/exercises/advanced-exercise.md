## Common Pitfalls

1. **Underestimating Data Volume**: Plan for 10x growth
2. **Ignoring Business Rules**: They're as important as ML
3. **Over-Engineering**: Start simple, iterate
4. **Poor Monitoring**: You can't improve what you don't measure
5. **Bias Amplification**: Monitor and mitigate biases
6. **Single Point of Failure**: Design for redundancy

## Success Tips

1. **Think End-to-End**: From data collection to user impact
2. **Balance Complexity**: Sophisticated but maintainable
3. **Plan for Operations**: Not just development
4. **Consider Edge Cases**: They matter at scale
5. **Document Decisions**: Explain your reasoning
6. **Validate Assumptions**: Back claims with data/research

Remember: This PRP will guide a large team building a revenue-critical system. It must be comprehensive, technically sound, and aligned with business objectives. The implementation should be sophisticated enough to compete with industry leaders while being practical enough to deliver in one quarter.

Good luck with your advanced PRP! You're designing a system that will impact millions of users and generate millions in revenue! 🚀
